# What is the point of this repository?

This repository focuses on rewriting my previous project and making it more readable 

# What was my previous project?

My previous project was a ***work*** related taks where i needed to programm a functioning *Pokemon* combat system to get more familiar with OOP. The *game* is console only and therefore has no GUI (which is a result of the project lasting only 3 1/2 days)

# What needs to be rewritten?

Due to time constraints (and also me being stupid lol) the code has still a few minor bugs, has quite a lot of redundant code and is pretty unreadable. To put it in a nutshell **most** of the code needs to be rewritten /: 

# How does the game work?

Basically there are 4 starter *Pokemons* with 4 attacks each (a few of them are placeholders like the *Poison Powder* attack).

  ![Pokemon Starter Pick]()

You start by choosing two of those four (your opponent receives the remaining *Pokemons*). Afterwards the fight starts and the first turn is decided by the *Pokemons* **speed** stat. You can either attack or switch *Pokemons* and the rest works like a standard *Pokemon* fight
